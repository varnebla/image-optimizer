        Processing many images individually can be slow and inefficient,
        especially when working on web projects that require fast loading times
        and optimized assets. This bulk image optimizer lets you convert and
        compress multiple images at once directly in your browser. Upload JPG,
        PNG, WebP or other formats and instantly transform them into optimized
        WebP or AVIF files.

        The tool uses smart compression to reduce file size while preserving
        visual quality, helping you improve performance, speed up Core Web
        Vitals and prepare your assets for modern, high-performance websites.
        Since all processing happens locally in your browser, your images never
        leave your device — ensuring full privacy and security.

        Bulk optimization is ideal for developers, designers, photographers and
        content creators who need an efficient workflow. Whether you’re
        preparing images for a blog, an e-commerce site, or a large-scale web
        project, this tool helps you generate lightweight, optimized images with
        minimal effort.
